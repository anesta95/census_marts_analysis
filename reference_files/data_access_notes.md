Data source is [here](https://www.census.gov/retail/sales.html)

Census [Economic Indicators API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/economic-indicators.html),
which now includes MARTS. Will have the [user guide](https://www2.census.gov/data/api-documentation/EITS_API_User_Guide_Dec2020.pdf)
and [data dictionaries](https://www.census.gov/econ_datasets/).  

Potentially use [this R package](https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/index.html) instead
of direct API calls.

Here is some specific information about how to use the Census Econ API & sources: 
* [MARTS API](https://api.census.gov/data/timeseries/eits/marts.html).
* [EITS API User Guide](https://www2.census.gov/data/api-documentation/EITS_API_User_Guide_Dec2020.pdf)
* The various [EITS Data Dictionaries](https://www.census.gov/econ_datasets/) 
that can be downloaded.
